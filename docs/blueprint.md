- Accent color: Violet (#8F00FF), an analogous color to indigo, creating contrast and drawing attention to interactive elements.

- Design a clear and intuitive drag-and-drop interface for easy content uploading.
- Implement subtle animations to enhance user experience, such as loading indicators and feedback for interactions.
